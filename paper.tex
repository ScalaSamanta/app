\section*{Introduction}

The opposite thumb allows humans to distinguish themselves from the others animal species. The morphological hand configuration and the kinematic coordination between all fingers have a crucial role in the manipulative abilities, precision-pinch grips as well as power “squeeze” grips \cite{napier1956prehensile} \cite{marzke1997precision} \cite{marzke1992evolution}. Thumb, in particular, is the finger who has the larger representative area in the brain. It covers about 50\% of the interior cortical area related to the hand and its loss or absence causes the loss of 40\% of hand functionality \cite{flatt2002our}. 

Surgery is usually recommended for many injuries or degenerative diseases of this digit. Hand rehabilitation has to be focus to avoid or prevent stiffness caused by a prolonged immobilization after surgery.
The term \textit stiff is commonly used to describe an increasing rigidity but stiffness of the hand is more properly a loss of the elastic configuration of the collagen fibers \cite{frank1984physiology}. Active motion can provide several benefits for the strength of healing tissues and they are well described in literature \cite{akeson1987effects} \cite{cyr1998controlled} \cite{gelberman1981influence}, including the realignment and orientation of collagen fibers. Moreover, muscle contraction resulting from active motion can stimulate the motor cortex
